# Simulating A Double Pendulum Model Using Python
This repo is dedicated to simulate a Double Pendulum Model using Python and associated libraries.

## What is Double Pendulum Model?
- As per Wikipedia a double pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end
- It is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions.
- Your fidget spinner works on the same principle.

## What's So Special About Does Double Pendulum ?
* A double pendulum has two degrees of freedom. That means that with two variables, you could describe the orientation of the whole device.
* You can't just use some equation to calculate these forces because they are forces of constraint
* This angle is measured from a vertical line but this variable by itself does not give the whole motion of the lower mass.
* The best method to solve this problem is to use Lagrangian mechanicsâ€”a system that uses energy and constraints to obtain an equation of motion.

## Libraries Required
- Tkinter for Visualisation.
- Math for Mathematical Oprations.
- Random to keep things random and progressive.
